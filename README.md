# PlatformerGameRevival

Hi ! Well, it's the third repo I've done since I begin this "not so little" project.

Simply put, I want to create a platformer in Java without any library not include in Java directly.
Why ? Well, my objective is to understand how a game work from A to Z. It's kind of a crazy
(and stupid) project but I really want to accomplish something before going full on a real engine.

So yes, third one, I'm kinda discovering git as well (as a personnal git anyway). So what happen ?
Simple, I'm stupid. But I learn some valuable lesson from the previous, DON'T merge.

I you interest in my progress, you can open my TODO.txt in which I write what I've done and what I need
to do.

#Thanks for reading my code.
